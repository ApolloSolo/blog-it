When you are ready to share the results of your work, [rebase](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/contribute-to-projects.html?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=10116875233&gclid=CjwKCAjwoduRBhA4EiwACL5RPwRCscIRY-jH-olu0ltpGsBNk4a8XTZqANyML6Ff8yHeTCtiOt1hqRoCP5YQAvD_BwE#rebase-fork) your fork on the current HEAD of the master branch in the original project. This is needed to make sure your changes do not conflict with new commits that were pushed after you created your fork. Create a pull request to suggest your changes to the original project.
